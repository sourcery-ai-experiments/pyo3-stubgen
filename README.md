# pyo3-stubgen

`pyo3-stubgen` generates `.pyi` typing files for extension modules which were written in rust with pyo3.

It is designed to work for extension modules created in rust with pyo3 but should work with any compiled extension
modules which include a `__text_signature__` and optionally a `__doc__` attribute for functions.

Despite flake8's recommendation to the contrary, `pyo3_stubgen` adds docstrings to the `.pyi` files so that IDEs can
provide them in hover pop-ups.

You will need to manually add the typing information to the generated files as this is not included in any of the
function attributes available and is just as dependent upon the semantics of your functions as on the technical
implementation.

Note: Currently `pyo3_stubgen` only generates info for functions. Classes are on the to-do list.

## Installation

Install via pip:

```sh
(.venv)/projectroot$ pip install pyo3-stubgen
```

## Usage

Easiest from the command line:

```sh

```
